## Content
I figure it might be helpful to outline what you will and **won't** find on this blog.

### What you WILL find:
- **Tech Tutorials.** A lot of what I write has
  good instructional value.
- **My Opinions.** I write from my own point of
  view. Don't be surprised if something is
  opinionated.
- **Rants.** I often write when I'm frustrated
  with something. It often helps me solve the
  problem, and it can be informational to
  someone else with the same problem.
- **Swearing.** I have some specific views on
  language, and long story short, I don't
  often filter my language. This does not
  include slurs; I don't use slurs. **Make sure
  you are okay with strong language.**

### What you WON'T find:
- **18+/NSFW Content.** Not here. No thanks.
- **Hate Speech.** Everyone is different, in 
  every way except one. The one we share is 
  the one that should unite us: **We are 
  humans.** Hate speech is counterproductive
  to our society, and you won't see any of it
  here.
