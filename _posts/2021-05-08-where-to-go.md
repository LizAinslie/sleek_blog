This past week has been hell for me, and I'll cut to the chase: I don't really know where I am going from here. I don't really even know how to start writing about it, but I'll do my best. It is also important to note that this is my side of the equation, and not meant to harm anyone at all. Essentially, I'm just venting.

# The First Week
A bit of context first. I don't have a good relationship with my parents, and I just turned 18. Meaning the threats of being kicked out sting a lot more now than they did a year ago. This is very emotionally exhausting to deal with, especially for someone like myself, who is on the autistic spectrum.

It is also worth mentioning that I have been in a romantic relationship since January, which will play into things.

## The Start
My week started with a really awful Monday. I had a bad day at work, and as usual I get into a call with my boyfriend, because if I call someone else (friends, etc.) I'll be dealing with a frustrated boyfriend. Same deal if I don't call at all. What's different this time, however, is that I had just attempted suicide on the way home. I don't really know why, but I had a really strong, sudden urge to swerve off the road. I would've hit some cliffs and died had I not got a grip on my emotions and stopped the car. 

During the call, I had another urge and so I muted and deafened to try and OD on painkillers in the bathroom. Sometime during the call, my boyfriend had done some things on Twitter to instigate my friends, which was another reason I had been having suicidal ideations. I was tired of having to balance social and romantic life because my boyfriend couldn't get along with my friends, or at least leave them alone.

The next day at work, suicidal thoughts were back, and I couldn't stop it. I talked to some coworkers who were all concerned, and they suggested I cut it off, at least temporarily. So, that night when I got home, I told my boyfriend I couldn't do a romantic relationship for the foreseeable future, but I was willing to remain friends. His response was "k". The thing that hurt the most was that the night before in the call he told me that if he ever responded "k" or "okay" it meant he didn't care. 

## Off Days
The next two days I was off work, so I spent time with some friends. All of that was about as good as it could've been, given the circumstances. Certain things happened that I won't mention, but nothing too terribly bad, just embarrassing stuff.

## Fri "yay"
However, on Friday, my dad gave me thirty days to find a place to live. This is why I don't really know where I can go from here. I have to figure out how I'm going to pay for a place, food, and everything else important.

# Update On Relesase, I Guess
I wrote all of that above on Sunday the 2nd. It is now Saturday the 8th and oh my god it gets worse (and better, kinda). I feel like a nuisance, and honestly a dipshit. Over the past few days, it has gotten harder and harder to get along with people, even the people I care about and I'm considering just giving up socially. White flag of surrender and never speak to people again, essentially. I can't go five minutes without pissing someone else off and I feel terrible every time I talk to people. That being said, someone sent $100 to my PayPal today with a message "Go get some salt chips and an apartment". While that $100 won't cover an entire apartment it will help a whole lot with the deposit; so thanks to whoever sent it, it feels a little bit less painful to be alive right now.

## The Future
I guess I'll be moving out soon. I don't know what else, and honestly I can't motivate myself to do anything at all; we'll see. Right now I just want things to mellow out and I think it might happen soon. Aside from that, I'm hoping I can motivate myself to get back to work on Synapse, and I'm finding it somewhat easier to do things I once enjoyed. I haven't had suicidal ideations since the night that I attempted twice, so that feels good. I guess I'll just have to wait and see how things go socially though.
